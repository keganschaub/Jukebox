# Jukebox

To compile and run:

javac -cp /usr/share/java/junit4.jar model/*.java songplayer/*.java tests/*.java usage/*.java view/*.java

java view.JukeboxGUI

Program quirk:

Mp3 files won't play using the standard command-line way. The project was originally programmed in IDE Eclipse, so it is likely that the mp3s will play if it is ran in Eclipse because IDEs use add ons to take care of unsupported file types. 

Credit goes to Rick Mercer for giving the assignment and to Brian Lee for contributing to the development of the program.
